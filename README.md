# The Wardrobe (work in progress)

The Wardrobe is an e-commerce store that sells clothing and accessories.

## Description

Created with **React.js** and hosted on **Firebase**, the current version of this web app manages the state (including _user_, _cart_, _directory_ and _shop data_) using **React-Redux.js**. It also allows online customers to create accounts through the integrated Firebase authentication & database services. [Stripe API](https://stripe.com) is also implemented to handle card payments (which currently can be tested out using the default credit card provided upon checking out).

Next improvements will aim for optimizations in state management with React Hooks, as well as in back-end charges through Stripe payments.
